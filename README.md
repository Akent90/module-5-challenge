# Work Day Scheduler

## Overview

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple, easy-to-use calendar application designed for scheduling your workday. It displays standard business hours from 9 AM to 5 PM and allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating libraries such as Bootstrap, Font Awesome, jQuery, and Day.js.

## Features

Current Day Display: The current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar.
Time Blocks for Standard Business Hours: The scheduler includes time blocks for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM.
Color-Coded Time Blocks: Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green), based on the current time.
Event Entry: Users can click into a time block to enter an event.

Click the save button on the right of the time block to save the event. Your event will be stored locally and remain visible even after refreshing the page.
